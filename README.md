# Hi there, I'm Mariia Karabatova üëã
# I'm data analyst. I'm looking for a job

## With 2 years of analytical experience at Social Discovery Group, I have honed my skills using Excel (including VLOOKUP, INDEX, IFERROR, COUNTIF, Pivot Tables, and more), VBA for task automation, and Google Sheets. I have further upgraded my analytical toolkit by completing the Data Analyst course at Yandex.Practicum, where I executed 10 projects using SQL (Postgresql), Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), Jupyter Notebook, and Tableau. I am open to remote work, willing to align with your time zone, and available to work as a self-employed professional.
